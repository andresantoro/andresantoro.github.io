  <h3>New preprint: Charting Higher-Order Models of Brain Function</h3>
  <p>We present the first large-scale comparison of higher-order interaction (HOI) metrics — spanning information-theoretic and topological approaches — using fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project. Our analysis reveals a clear taxonomy of HOI metrics into redundant, synergistic, and topological classes, with topological descriptors acting as bridges between the two. All metrics align with the brain's functional hierarchy, and some also reflect neurotransmitter receptor distribution. HOI metrics outperform traditional functional connectivity models in brain fingerprinting and are equally effective in task decoding. Notably, topological measures show the strongest links to behavioral variability, highlighting their value in connecting brain structure and function. <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.24.661306v1" target="_blank">Read the preprint here</a>.</p>

  <h3>New preprint: The Topological Architecture of Brain Identity</h3>
  <p>Our collaborative work with colleagues from Italy and the US introduces a novel brain fingerprinting method based on homological scaffolds derived from persistent homology. This topological approach achieves near-perfect identification accuracy (~100%), significantly outperforming traditional functional connectivity methods. The research reveals that individual brain signatures are encoded in mesoscale network integration and information dynamics. <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2025/06/21/2025.06.20.660792.full.pdf" target="_blank">Read the preprint here</a>.</p>

  <h3>New preprint: Social Transmission along Multiple Pathways</h3>
  <p>Our new work, "Social Transmission along Multiple Pathways Promotes Information Fidelity and Reduces Divisiveness", is now out on PsyArXiv! This collaborative project, which began at the 2018 Santa Fe Complex Systems Summer School, shows that when information spreads through networks with multiple redundant paths, it retains higher fidelity and promotes consensus—even among people who never interact directly. Using a large-scale behavioral experiment and computational modeling, we reveal how minimal structural redundancy can significantly enhance the accuracy and cohesion of social communication. <a href="https://osf.io/dg8zj_v1" target="_blank">Read the preprint here</a>.</p>

  <h3>New preprint: Spine-Prints - Transposing Brain Fingerprints to the Spinal Cord</h3>
  <p>Our collaborative work with colleagues from Switzerland and Canada provides the first evidence of individual-specific connectivity patterns in the human spinal cord, extending the concept of brain fingerprinting beyond the brain. The study demonstrates that the cervical spinal cord exhibits reproducible, individual-specific functional connectivity patterns, opening new possibilities for personalized biomarkers in neurology and neurosurgery. <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2025/06/02/2025.05.30.656545.full.pdf" target="_blank">Read the preprint here</a>.</p>

  <h3>New preprint: Small-world scale-free brain networks from EEG</h3>
  <p>Our collaborative work on "Small-world scale-free brain networks from EEG with application to motor imagery decoding and brain fingerprinting" is now out on bioRxiv. This research proposes a novel method for inferring subject-specific brain graphs from EEG data that exhibit small-world and scale-free network properties. The approach shows promising results for motor imagery decoding and brain fingerprinting tasks, potentially enhancing EEG analysis for cognitive neuroscience and brain-computer interface applications. <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2025/05/28/2025.04.17.649421.full.pdf" target="_blank">Read the preprint here</a>.</p>
