  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>Many real-world systems—financial markets, brain networks, ecosystems—are shaped by group interactions that evolve over time. Standard network tools focus on pairwise links and can miss these higher-order interactions (HOIs). Topological Data Analysis (TDA), via simplicial complexes and related operators, provides a principled way to model HOIs. This project develops a scalable, spectral approach to detect and analyze instantaneous <em>k</em>-way co-fluctuations in multivariate temporal data.</p>

  <h3>Project Description</h3>
  <p>This project is both computational and theoretical. The student will be involved in refining and implementing a recent framework to analyze multivariate time-series. Key tasks will include: 1) Understanding the mathematics of spectral theory and TDA for temporal data; 2) Implementing the method to detect "k-order co-fluctuations" from signals; 3) Validating the approach by testing it on synthetic signals to assess its performance and scalability. 4) Applying the new method to a real-world dataset (e.g., social or financial data) to uncover novel insights.</p>
