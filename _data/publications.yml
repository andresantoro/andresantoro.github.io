    abstract: "Traditional graph signal processing (GSP) methods applied to brain networks focus on signals defined on the nodes. Thus, they are unable to capture potentially important dynamics occurring on the edges. In this work, we adopt an edge-centric GSP approach to analyze edge signals constructed from 100 unrelated subjects of the Human Connectome Project. Specifically, we describe structural connectivity through the lens of the 1-dimensional Hodge Laplacian, processing signals defined on edges to capture co-fluctuation information between brain regions. We demonstrate that edge-based approaches achieve superior task decoding accuracy in static and dynamic scenarios compared to conventional node-based techniques, thereby unveiling unique aspects of brain functional organization. These findings underscore the promise of edge-focused GSP strategies for deepening our understanding of brain connectivity and functional dynamics."

    abstract: "Traditional models of brain connectivity focus on pairwise interactions, missing the complex dynamics from group-level interactions. In this work, we present the first large-scale comparison of higher-order interaction (HOI) metrics — spanning information-theoretic and topological methods — using resting-state and task fMRI data from 100 Human Connectome Project subjects. We uncover a clear taxonomy of HOI metrics: redundant, synergistic, and topological, with the latter bridging the synergy–redundancy spectrum. Despite methodological differences, all metrics align with the brain's unimodal-to-transmodal hierarchy, and some correlate with neurotransmitter receptor distributions. HOI metrics outperform traditional functional connectivity in fingerprinting and match it in task decoding. Crucially, topological metrics best predict behavioral variability, highlighting their value for understanding the links between brain function, structure, and cognition. This work offers a roadmap for applying HOI metrics in cognitive and clinical neuroscience."

    doi: "10.1101/2025.06.20.660792"
    abstract: "Accurately identifying individuals from brain activity --functional fingerprinting-- is a powerful tool for understanding individual variability and detecting brain disorders. Most current approaches rely on functional connectivity (FC), which measures pairwise correlations between brain regions. However, FC is limited in capturing the higher-order, multiscale structure of brain organization. Here, we propose a novel fingerprinting method based on homological scaffolds, a topological representation derived from persistent homology of resting-state fMRI data. Using data from the Human Connectome Project (n= 100), we show that scaffold-based fingerprints achieve near-perfect identification accuracy (~ 100%), outperforming FC-based methods (90%), and remain robust across preprocessing pipelines, atlas choices, and even with drastically shortened scan durations. Unlike FC, in which fingerprinting features localize within networks, scaffolds derive their discriminative power from inter-network connections, revealing the existence of individual mesoscale organizational signatures. Finally, we show that scaffolds act as bridges between redundancy and synergy, by balancing redundancy along high-FC border edges with high synergy across the topological voids that the cycles define. These findings establish topological scaffolds as a powerful tool for capturing individual variability, revealing that unique signatures of brain organization are encoded in the interplay between mesoscale network integration and information dynamics."

    doi: "10.1101/2025.05.30.656545"
    abstract: "Functional connectivity (FC) patterns in the human brain form a reproducible, individual-specific 'fingerprint' that allows reliable identification of the same participant across scans acquired over different sessions. While brain fingerprinting is robust across healthy individuals and neuroimaging modalities, little is known about whether the fingerprinting principle extends beyond the brain. Here, we used multiple spinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets acquired at different sites to examine whether a fingerprint can be revealed from FCs of the cervical region of the human spinal cord. Our results demonstrate that the functional organisation of the cervical spinal cord also exhibits individual-specific properties, suggesting the potential existence of a spine-print within the same acquisition session. This study provides the first evidence of a spinal cord connectivity fingerprint, underscoring the importance of considering a more comprehensive view of the entire central nervous system. Eventually, these spine-specific signatures could contribute to identifying individualized biomarkers of neuronal connectivity, with potential clinical applications in neurology and neurosurgery."

    doi: "10.1101/2025.04.17.649421"
    abstract: "Developing individualized spatial models that capture the complex dynamics of multi-electrode EEG data is essential for accurately decoding global neural activity. A widely used approach is network modeling, where electrodes are represented as nodes. A key challenge lies in defining the network edges and weights, as precise connectivity estimation is critical for enhancing neural characterization and extracting discriminative features, such as those needed for task decoding. In this work, we propose a method for inferring subject-specific brain graphs from EEG data, explicitly designed to exhibit small-world and scale-free network properties. Our approach begins by computing phase-locking values between EEG channel pairs to build a backbone graph, which is then refined into an individualized small-world and scale-free network. To reduce computational complexity while preserving subject-specific characteristics, we apply Kron reduction to the resulting graph. We evaluated the proposed method on motor imagery decoding and brain fingerprinting tasks using two EEG datasets. Results show that our model consistently outperforms other benchmark graph models. Furthermore, we show that integrating classical EEG features with those derived using graph signal processing principles significantly improves performance. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of the proposed graph construction framework to enhance EEG analysis, with promising implications for a wide range of applications in cognitive neuroscience and brain-computer interface research."
